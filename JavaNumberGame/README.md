# Overview

This is a guess the number game written in Java. The program will randomly select a number between 1 and 100 that the user has to guess. As they guess, the program will tell them if they need to guess higher or lower.  As a software engineer I am trying to learn new skills, languages, and expand my knowledge. My purpose for writing this was to learn the syntax of Java and write some simple beginner code. This program implements loops variables, and functions.
